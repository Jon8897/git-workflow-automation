#!/bin/bash

# This is a shebang that specifies the interpreter for this script.
# In this case, it tells the shell to use the Bash interpreter.

# Replace with the path to your Git repository
REPO_PATH="/path/to/repo"

# This sets the repository path to a variable that will be used later in the script.

# Create a new branch
NEW_BRANCH_NAME="my_new_feature"
git -C "$REPO_PATH" checkout master
git -C "$REPO_PATH" branch "$NEW_BRANCH_NAME"

# This creates a new branch in the Git repository with the specified name (`my_new_feature` in this case).
# First, the script checks out the `master` branch using the `checkout` command.
# Then, it creates a new branch with the specified name using the `branch` command.

# Make some changes
echo "New line added" >> "$REPO_PATH/file.txt"

# This adds a new line of text to a file named `file.txt` in the repository.
# The `echo` command outputs the text "New line added" to the console,
# and the `>>` operator appends it to the end of the file.

# Commit the changes
COMMIT_MESSAGE="Added new line to file.txt"
git -C "$REPO_PATH" add "$REPO_PATH/file.txt"
git -C "$REPO_PATH" commit -m "$COMMIT_MESSAGE"

# This adds the changes made in the previous step to the Git staging area using the `add` command.
# The script then creates a new commit with the specified commit message (`Added new line to file.txt` in this case)
# using the `commit` command.

# Merge changes from another branch
OTHER_BRANCH_NAME="other_feature"
git -C "$REPO_PATH" checkout "$OTHER_BRANCH_NAME"
git -C "$REPO_PATH" merge "$NEW_BRANCH_NAME"

# This checks out an existing branch (`other_feature` in this case) using the `checkout` command.
# The script then merges in the changes from the new branch created earlier (`my_new_feature` in this case)
# using the `merge` command.

# Resolve conflicts, if any
if [[ -n $(git -C "$REPO_PATH" status --porcelain) ]]; then
  # Handle conflicts here
  # ...
  # After resolving conflicts, add the changes and commit
  # git -C "$REPO_PATH" add <files>
  # git -C "$REPO_PATH" commit -m "Resolved conflicts"
  echo "Conflicts detected. Please resolve them manually."
  exit 1
fi

# This checks if there are any conflicts after merging the branches.
# If there are conflicts, the script outputs a message asking you to resolve them manually.
# You can modify this part of the script to handle conflicts automatically if you want.

# Push the changes to the remote repository
REMOTE_NAME="origin"
REMOTE_BRANCH_NAME="$NEW_BRANCH_NAME"
git -C "$REPO_PATH" push "$REMOTE_NAME" "$REMOTE_BRANCH_NAME"

# This pushes the changes made in earlier steps to the remote repository with the specified remote name (`origin` in this case)
# and branch name (`my_new_feature` in this case) using the `push` command.
