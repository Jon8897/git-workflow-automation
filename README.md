# git-workflow-automation

- Creating a script that automates common Git tasks, such as creating new branches, merging changes, and resolving conflicts.

## The Git automation script we've discussed is designed to help you automate common Git tasks, specifically:

- Creating a new branch
- Making changes to files in the repository
- Committing the changes with a commit message
- Merging changes from a new branch into an existing branch
- Resolving conflicts, if any
- Pushing the changes to a remote repository

## Here's a more detailed explanation of each step:

1. Creating a new branch: The script checks out the master branch and creates a new branch with the specified name (my_new_feature in the example code). This is useful if you're working on a new feature or bug fix that you don't want to merge into the master branch yet.

2. Making changes to files in the repository: The script appends a new line to a file named file.txt, but you can modify this to make any changes you want to your files.

3. Committing the changes with a commit message: The script adds the changes to the Git staging area and commits them with a commit message (Added new line to file.txt in the example code).

4. Merging changes from a new branch into an existing branch: The script checks out an existing branch (other_feature in the example code) and merges in the changes from the new branch created in step 1 (my_new_feature in the example code).

5. Resolving conflicts, if any: The script checks if there are any conflicts after merging the branches. If there are conflicts, it outputs a message asking you to resolve the conflicts manually. You can modify this part of the script to handle conflicts automatically if you want.

6. Pushing the changes to a remote repository: The script pushes the changes to the remote repository with the specified remote name (origin in the example code) and branch name (my_new_feature in the example code).

Overall, the script is intended to make it easier to perform common Git tasks that you might otherwise have to do manually. By automating these tasks, you can save time and reduce the risk of errors when working with Git.
